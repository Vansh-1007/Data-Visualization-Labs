## **Introduction**
The IRIS dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and data visualization. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three speciesâ€”*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. Each sample includes four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

This lab demonstrates basic data handling, summary statistics, and filtering techniques.

## **Dataset Overview**
- **File Format:** CSV  
- **Features:**  
  - SepalLengthCm  
  - SepalWidthCm  
  - PetalLengthCm  
  - PetalWidthCm  
  - Species  
- **Rows and Columns:** 150 rows, 5 columns

## **Tasks Performed**

### **1. Data Loading and Inspection**
- Imported necessary libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`.  
- Loaded the IRIS dataset from a CSV file.  
- Displayed the first and last `n` rows for a quick overview.  
- Checked the dataset's shape and printed column names.  
- Accessed individual elements for better understanding of the data.  
- Retrieved data type information for each column.  

### **2. Data Manipulation**
- Added and removed specific rows/columns.  
- Filtered the dataset to include only rows where the `Species` is "setosa".  

### **3. Data Summary**
Calculated the following summary statistics for numerical columns:  
- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median  
- **Measures of Dispersion:** Standard Deviation, Variance  
- **Extreme Values:** Minimum, Maximum, Quartiles, Range  

### **4. Visualization**
- Counted the number of instances for each species.  
- Plotted a basic bar plot to visualize species counts.  

---

## **Results and Insights**
- The filtered dataset for *Iris setosa* contains 50 rows.  
- The mean and median values for each feature were close, indicating a relatively symmetric distribution.  
- The standard deviation and variance provided insights into the variability of the data.  
- A bar plot revealed that the dataset is balanced, with equal instances for each species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*).
